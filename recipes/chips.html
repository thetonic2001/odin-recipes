  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Tortillas</li>
    <li>Lime Juice</li>
    <li>Vegetable oil</li>
    <li>Spices</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Cut the tortillas into triangles â€” you should be able to get about eight chips out of each tortilla.</li>
    <li>Season the Chips
      Add lime juice and oil to a spray bottle and spray each chip. You can also brush the oil and lime juice mixture with a pastry brush. Sprinkle each chip with the spices.</li>
    <li>Bake the chips, flipping and re-seasoning halfway through. Make sure to check them often so they don't burn.</li>
  </ol>
